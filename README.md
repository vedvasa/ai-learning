# AI Learning

A project-based path from notebook experiments to production AI applications.
The repository will grow into **KnowledgeDesk**, a deployed support and research
assistant built through ten incremental releases.

## Curriculum

- [Production AI self-learning guide](PRODUCTION_AI_SELF_LEARNING_GUIDE.md)
- [Learning progress tracker](LEARNING_PROGRESS_TRACKER.md)

## Local setup

This project uses [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for Python and dependency
management.

```bash
uv sync --locked --no-editable
uv run --no-sync ai-learning
```

The Python version is pinned in `.python-version`, while exact dependency
versions are recorded in `uv.lock`.

## Repository hygiene

Commit source code, project configuration, migrations, tests, documentation,
and `uv.lock`. Do not commit virtual environments, secrets, local caches,
logs, or generated build artifacts; these are covered by `.gitignore`.
